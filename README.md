Status: The sample app is happily using the renderer, and I'm busy adding both components and internal functionality to it.

I'm always keeping an eye on the `#general` chat of the [NativeScript Slack](https://nativescriptcommunity.slack.com) if you'd like to talk about this project. If this gets unexpected traction, I could look into setting up a dedicated Gitter.

## Setup

The library is not stable yet, so I won't be publishing it to npm anytime soon. For now, you can install the latest commit of the project directly from GitHub at any time. The following instructions assume that you'll be developing in TypeScript.

```sh
# Create a project like this (or continue from an existing one)
tns create mycoolapp --tsc
cd mycoolapp

# In your NativeScript project.
npm install --save https://github.com/shirakaba/react-nativescript.git
npm install --save react
npm install --save-dev @types/react

# In one shell (transpiles your project's TypeScript to JS):
node_modules/.bin/tsc --project ./tsconfig.tns.json --watch

# In another shell (builds the project from your transpiled JS sources):
tns run ios --bundle --syncAllFiles --emulator

# OPTIONAL (library development only): You can also update the source library:
cd node_modules/react-nativescript
node_modules/.bin/tsc --watch
```

Please file an Issue if you meet any problems when following these instructions. They could well be missing something!

## Examples

### Hello World app

For now, I'm not focusing on JSX/TSX, but it may well work (just add `"jsx": "react"` to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions`). Here is how to make a `<ContentView>` component (a React wrapper around a NativeScript ContentView) without JSX:

```typescript
// In app.ts
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactNativeScript from "react-nativescript/dist/index";
import { ContentView, Label } from "react-nativescript/dist/index";

ReactNativeScript.startWithFrame(
    React.createElement(
        ContentView,
        {
            backgroundColor: "orange"
        },
        React.createElement(
            Label,
            {
                /* Write text either as a prop or as a child. */
                // text: "Hello, world!"
            },
            "Hello, world!"
        )
    )
);
```

There are some more complex components to test (or refer to) in [`sample/app/testComponents/testComponents.ts`](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-nativescript/blob/master/sample/app/testComponents/testComponents.ts). GameLoop has some potential ;)

### Layouts

All layouts are supported. Here are a few samples:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <img width="200px" src="/github_img/DockLayout.png"/>
            </td>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <img width="200px" src="/github_img/AbsoluteLayout.png"/>
            </td>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <img width="200px" src="/github_img/FlexboxLayout.png"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <p><b>DockLayout</b></p>
            </td>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <p><b>AbsoluteLayout</b></p>
            </td>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">
                <p><b>FlexboxLayout</b></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" valign="middle">

## Why not just use React Native? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There are great benefits to being able to use React as a renderer for NativeScript, rather than React Native.

* NativeScript runs on the main thread, so you avoid a lot of async dances and message-pasting between threads for achieving certain things (see particularly the next point)
* NativeScript has complete bindings to the native APIs, so you never need to write a plugin every time you just want to access/set a property on a native view
* NativeScript projects simply build and install much more quickly than a React Native project because the codebase is leaner
* The NativeScript codebase is far more approachable to contributors
* This repo is written in TypeScript from the ground up (just like NativeScript), so typings will always be in sync and correct.

## Contributing üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ideally get in contact via the Slack channel before starting any PRs.

I want to keep complex tooling down to a minimum to encourage easy on-boarding to contributors ‚Äì at least until the project is stable.

## Current state üö¶

This checklist is expanded upon in the roadmap below.

Note that 'basic support' may mean "seen to work in very specific favourable circumstances".

* [x] Basic child-nesting support
* [x] Basic text component support
* [x] Basic styles support (if it exists on View)
* [x] Props and State changes lead to re-renders üéâ
* [x] Support for custom components (I *think* these work already; will check)
* [x] Support for multiple children inside an instance
* [x] Support for Portals
* [x] Basic ListView support
* [x] Mapping event-handler props to event handlers (e.g. `onTap` prop maps to `on("tap")` for Button component)
* [x] Mapping React refs to native components (I've given an example in Button)
* [x] Support [FormattedString](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/bolding-italicizing-and-underlining-portions-of-text-in-nativescript)
* [x] Support for context
* [ ] Implement CSS cascading (assuming that NativeScript Core uses it at all..?)
* [ ] Create React Components for each of the NativeScript Core views (there are a few of them!)
* [ ] Map the React NativeScript Components to platform-agnostic [React primitives](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives) to support multi-platform apps! [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) may become relevant here.
* [ ] Handling of props other than by `Observer.setValue()` (I'll gradually discover where this is needed)
* [ ] Support for non-visual components (however, do ReactDOM and React Native even support this..?)
* [ ] Mapping flexbox styles to FlexboxLayout components NOTE: these are based on [Google's FlexboxLayout repo](https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout) and not fully conformant with [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/).
* [ ] JSX/TSX (note: this is probably handled by TypeScript/Babel, so maybe nothing to implement here). [Nick Iliev](https://github.com/NickIliev) recommends studying `nativescript-tsx`: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PanayotCankov/nativescript-tsx); [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-tsx)
* [ ] Tests. I see that the [Nativescript Vue](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue) repo has a rather advanced [set of runnable tests](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue/tree/master/samples/app). I was unable to get the sample app to build though, hence my desire to keep tooling simple. We could work towards something like this.

## Potential for API compatibility with React Native üèö

Initially, my vision for this renderer was for it to be a drop-in skinny replacement for `react-native`. As much as I'd like it to be 100% compatible, though, I can see already that there are limitations.

* NativeScript's core components simply offer less customisability than React Native's ones; e.g. there are no accessibility options as far as I can see.
* React Native exposes iOS-specific and Android-specific props on its components, whereas NativeScript strictly uses a common set of props.
* Some core components exist only in one or the other of the two libraries.
* Tricky pieces of UI like Modals, Navigation Bars, and Status Bars are unlikely to have any good overlap between the two frameworks
* FlexBox is handled at the CSS level in React Native, but via a FlexBoxLayout component in NativeScript; also my impression is that React Native's FlexBox implementation is far more conformant to the CSS spec than NativeScript's one.
* NativeScript runs on the main thread, whereas React Native runs on a separate thread, so each library may approach certain tasks in different ways (e.g. some properties may be synchronous in NativeScript while they're asynchronous in React Native).
* React Native's event handling is very different from NativeScript's (not to mention complex). Preact does fine without it, so I'll not be implementing things their way, either.
* React Native is a constantly moving target. I don't want this project to live or die based on how well it matches any given version of React Native.

A middle ground would be to produce a middleware to remap props to that of React Native, but I'd rather not support two sets of APIs, so this would be left to the community as a separate undertaking.
